# Weather information scrapping using Selenium

Some websites offer API keys allowing to collect historical weather data. Most of time, it is not the case or i is not free. In this project, I am using [Selinium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) to automate the control of the browser (google chrome in my case) and scrap weather data from the HTML source. <br>

Note that you need to pip install selenium and chromedriver, then download and install the [Selenium driver](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html), preferably in the project directory to simplify things or make sure to note where it has been downloaded and use that path when calling the webdriver in your Python code.
